The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Kyuubi
has invited Paul Lin to become a committer and we are pleased 
to announce that he has accepted.

Paul works at NetEase Games, he

- has been contributing to Kyuubi Flink engine since Jan. 2022
- refactored Flink engine by migrating to Flink SQL gateway
- implemented Flink engine YARN application mode
- supported Flink job control statements by driving joint efforts on Kyuubi community and Flink community
- made a major contribution to Flink engine type system
- participated in various discussions on the mail list and GitHub issues
- helped users resolve problems on GitHub and WeChat
- reviewed and make suggestions on designs and PRs related to the Flink engine
- improved contributor experience by adding issue templates and fixing CI issues

Being a committer enables easier contribution to the
project since there is no need to go via the patch
submission process. This should enable better productivity.
A PMC member helps manage and guide the direction of the project.

Please join me in congratulating Paul!
