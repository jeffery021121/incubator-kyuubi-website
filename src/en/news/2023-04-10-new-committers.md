The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Kyuubi
has invited [Tianlin Liao](https://github.com/lightning-L) to become our committer and
we are pleased to announce that she has accepted.

Tianlin Liao is currently working in eBay Shanghai. She joined Kyuubi community 1 year ago.

Her contributions are as follows

Please join me in congratulating Tianlin!

Being a committer enables easier contribution to the
project since there is no need to go via the patch
submission process. This should enable better productivity.
A PMC member helps manage and guide the direction of the project.
