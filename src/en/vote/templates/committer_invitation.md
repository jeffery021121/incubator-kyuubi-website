Hello ${NEW_COMMITTER_NAME},

The Kyuubi Project Management Committee (PMC) 
hereby offers you committer privileges to the project.
These privileges are offered on the understanding that
you'll use them reasonably and with common sense.
We like to work on trust rather than unnecessary constraints. 

Being a committer enables you to more easily make 
changes without needing to go through the patch 
submission process.

Being a committer does not require you to 
participate any more than you already do. It does 
tend to make one even more committed.  You will 
probably find that you spend more time here.

Of course, you can decline and instead remain as a 
contributor, participating as you do now.

A. This personal invitation is a chance for you to 
accept or decline in private.  Either way, please 
let us know in reply to the private@kyuubi.apache.org
address only.

B. If you accept, the next step is to register an iCLA:
    1. Details of the iCLA and the forms are found 
    through this link: https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas

    2. Instructions for its completion and return to 
    the Secretary of the ASF are found at
    https://www.apache.org/licenses/#submitting

    3. When you transmit the completed iCLA, request 
    to notify the Apache Kyuubi and choose a 
    unique Apache ID. Look to see if your preferred 
    ID is already taken at 
    https://people.apache.org/committer-index.html
    This will allow the Secretary to notify the PMC 
    when your iCLA has been recorded.

When recording of your iCLA is noted, you will 
receive a follow-up message with the next steps for 
establishing you as a committer.

Yours,
The Apache Kyuubi PMC

```
