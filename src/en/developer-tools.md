## Building Kyuubi

### Building Kyuubi with Apache Maven

**Kyuubi** is built based on [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org),

```
./build/mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

This results in the creation of all sub-modules of Kyuubi project without running any unit test.

If you want to test it manually, you can start Kyuubi directly from the Kyuubi project root by running

```
bin/kyuubi start
```

### Building a Submodule Individually

For instance, you can build the Kyuubi Common module using:

```
build/mvn clean package -pl :kyuubi-common -DskipTests
```

### Building Submodules Individually

For instance, you can build the Kyuubi Common module using:

```
build/mvn clean package -pl :kyuubi-common,:kyuubi-ha -DskipTests
```

### Skipping Some modules

For instance, you can build the Kyuubi modules without Kyuubi Codecov and Assembly modules using:

```
build/mvn clean install -pl '!:kyuubi-codecov,!:kyuubi-assembly' -DskipTests
```

### Building Kyuubi against Different Apache Spark versions

Since v1.1.0, Kyuubi support building with different Spark profiles,

| Profile     | Default | Since |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| -Pspark-3.0 | No      | 1.0.0 |
| -Pspark-3.1 | No      | 1.1.0 |
| -Pspark-3.2 | Yes     | 1.4.0 |
| -Pspark-3.3 | No      | 1.6.0 |

### Defining the Apache Mirror for Spark

By default, we use `https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/` to download the built-in Spark release package,
but if you find it hard to reach, or the downloading speed is too slow, you can define the `spark.archive.mirror`
property to a suitable Apache mirror site. For instance,

```
build/mvn clean package -Dspark.archive.mirror=https://mirrors.bfsu.edu.cn/apache/spark/spark-3.2.1
```

Visit [Apache Mirrors](http://www.apache.org/mirrors/) and choose a mirror based on your region.

Specifically for developers in China mainland, you can use the pre-defined profile named `mirror-cdn` which use
`mirrors.bfsu.edu.cn` to speed up Spark Binary downloading. For instance,

```
build/mvn clean package -Pmirror-cn
```

## Building a Runnable Distribution

To create a Kyuubi distribution like those distributed by [Kyuubi Release Page](https://github.com/apache/kyuubi/releases),
and that is laid out so as to be runnable, use `./build/dist` in the project root directory.

For more information on usage, run `./build/dist --help`

```logtalk
./build/dist - Tool for making binary distributions of Kyuubi

Usage:
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ./build/dist [--name <custom_name>] [--tgz] [--flink-provided] [--spark-provided] [--hive-provided]  |
|              [--mvn <maven_executable>] <maven build options>                                        |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
name:           -  custom binary name, using project version if undefined
tgz:            -  whether to make a whole bundled package
flink-provided: -  whether to make a package without Flink binary
spark-provided: -  whether to make a package without Spark binary
hive-provided:  -  whether to make a package without Hive binary
mvn:            -  external maven executable location
```

For instance,

```
./build/dist --name custom-name --tgz
```

This results a Kyuubi distribution named `kyuubi-{version}-bin-custom-name.tar.gz` for you.

If you are planing to deploy Kyuubi where `spark` is provided, in other word, it's not required to bundle spark binary, use

```
./build/dist --tgz --spark-provided
```

Then you will get a Kyuubi distribution without spark binary named `kyuubi-{version}-bin.tar.gz`.

## Building Kyuubi Documentation

Follow the steps below and learn how to build the Kyuubi documentation as the one you are watching now.

### Install & Activate `virtualenv`

Firstly, install `virtualenv`, this is optional but recommended as it is useful to create an independent environment to resolve dependency issues for building the documentation.

```
pip install virtualenv
```

Switch to the `docs` root directory.

```
cd $KTUUBI_HOME/docs
```

Create a virtual environment named 'kyuubi' or anything you like using `virtualenv` if it's not existing.

```
virtualenv kyuubi
```

Activate it,

```
 source ./kyuubi/bin/activate
```

### Install all dependencies

Install all dependencies enumerated in the `requirements.txt`

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Create Documentation

```
make html
```

If the build process succeed, the HTML pages are in `_build/html`.

### View Locally

Open the `_build/html/index.html` file in your favorite web browser.

## Running Tests

**Kyuubi** can be tested based on [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org) and the ScalaTest Maven Plugin,
please refer to the [ScalaTest documentation](http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/using_the_scalatest_maven_plugin),

### Running Tests Fully

The following is an example of a command to run all the tests:

```
./build/mvn clean test
```

### Running Tests for a Module

```
./build/mvn clean test -pl :kyuubi-common
```

### Running Tests for a Single Test

When developing locally, itâ€™s convenient to run one single test, or a couple of tests, rather than all.

With Maven, you can use the -DwildcardSuites flag to run individual Scala tests:

```
./build/mvn  test -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.kyuubi.service.FrontendServiceSuite
```

If you want to make a single test that need integrate with kyuubi-spark-sql-engine module, please build the package for kyuubi-spark-sql-engine module at first.

You can leverage the ready-made tool for creating a binary distribution.

```
./build/dist
```

## Debugging Kyuubi

You can use the [Java Debug Wire Protocol](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jpda/conninv.html#Plugin) to debug Kyuubi
with your favorite IDE tool, e.g. Intellij IDEA.

### Debugging Server

We can configure the JDWP agent in `KYUUBI_JAVA_OPTS` for debugging.


For example,
```
KYUUBI_JAVA_OPTS=-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005 \
bin/kyuubi start
```

In the IDE, you set the corresponding parameters(host&port) in debug configurations, for example,
<div align=center>

![](../imgs/idea_debug.png)

</div>

### Debugging Apps

- Spark Driver

```
spark.driver.extraJavaOptions   -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005
```

- Spark Executor
```
spark.executor.extraJavaOptions   -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005
```

## Developer Tools

### Update Project Version

```

build/mvn versions:set -DgenerateBackupPoms=false
```

### Update Document Version

Whenever Project version updates, please also update the document version at `docs/conf.py` to target the upcoming release.

For example,

```
release = '1.2.0'
```

### Update Dependency List

Kyuubi uses the `dev/dependencyList` file to indicates what upstream dependencies will actually go to the server-side classpath.

For Pull requests, a linter for dependency check will be automatically executed in GitHub Actions.


You can run `build/dependency.sh` locally first to detect the potential dependency change first.

If the changes look expected, run `build/dependency.sh --replace` to update `dev/dependencyList` in your Pull request.
